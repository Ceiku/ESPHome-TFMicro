# ESPHome-TFMicro
A custom component that imports and runs the hello world tensorflow micro example for esp32s modules.

It is based on the [EloquentTinyML](https://github.com/eloquentarduino/EloquentTinyML)
And further inspired by [ESP32-TensorFlow-Lite-Sample](https://github.com/wezleysherman/ESP32-TensorFlow-Lite-Sample)

This is just a proof of concept, it needs more flexibility to be properly usable as a component in ESPHome
